// while loading, and the GI update throttle from engine_tweaks. Values are saved in the profile as
// "ReSkate.Perf.<key>".

// They are pushed to the engine on the game update thread, only when something can have changed:
// once the saved values are read, after a change in the menu, and when a level or sublevel becomes
// active (the engine can put its own values back while loading), with one follow-up check a few
// seconds later. Between those events tick() costs a couple of comparisons.
